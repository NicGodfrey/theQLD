        data-FS-aboutText="Basic Rights Queensland (BRQ) is a service which provides legal advice and advocacy in the areas of of Centrelink assistance, disability discrimination and women’s workplace issued. The service was originally founded over thirty years ago as the ‘Welfare Rights Centre’. Since then, it has grown and in 2018 merged with Working Women Queensland.
        <br><br>
        Their team includes lawyers, social workers and volunteers, who work to provide community legal education, advocate for law reform and provide specialist services to other community organisations.
        <br><br>
        This service is funded by both State and Federal governments through the <a href='https://www.ag.gov.au/legal-system/legal-assistance-services/community-legal-services-program' target='_blank'>Community Legal Services Program.</a>"
        data-FS-helpText="Basic Rights Queensland can provide assistance if you are having Centrelink issues, facing disability discrimination or are a woman facing issues at the workplace. However, the service is only able to provide support for those who are very vulnerable and unable to advocate for themselves. 
        <br><br>
        BRQ may also be unable to provide support where they deem a case does not have merit or when facing issues with capacity.
