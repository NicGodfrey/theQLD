        data-FS-aboutText="Bayside Community Legal Service (BCLS) is a legal service founded in 1992 which provides legal support to the Bayside community. Their services include providing legal advice and representation, mediation, legal information, referrals and community legal education.
        <br><br>
        BCLS is heavily reliant on their volunteers made up of students, lawyers and mediators. Bayside Community Legal Service could not provide legal assistance to the Bayside community without the hardwork and dedication of their volunteers.
        <br><br>
        BCLS receives some funding through through Legal Aid Queensland, but also accepts individual tax-deductible donations.
        "
        data-FS-helpText="Bayside Community Legal Centre offers one-off, 30 minute advice appointments. These can be held by phone or in-person.
        <br><br>
        BCLS can only provide assistance within their practice areas. These include debt issues, property damage from a motor vehicle accident, neighbourhood disputes, tenancy, consumer complaints and bailment. They can also advise you on family law issues regarding domestic violence, divorce/separation and parenting. Within criminal law, they can provide advice in relation to criminal offences, traffic offences and breaches of domestic violence orders.
