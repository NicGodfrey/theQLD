        data-FS-aboutText="Caxton Legal Centre (CLC) is an independent, non-profit, non-government organisation.
        <br><br>
        In addition to providing legal assistance, CLC advocates for law reform, taking on various projects each year. A list of Caxton's law reform projects can be found here. 
        <br><br>
        CLC also implemented its first Innovative Reconciliation Action Plan in 2014 to further Australia's reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. In 2018, it launched its second Reconciliation Action Plan. 
        <br><br>
        CLC is supported by a collection of volunteer lawyers and law students. They accept funding from the federal and Queensland governments, as well as independent donations. Occasionally, CLC fundraises for particular cases."
        data-FS-helpText="Caxton Legal Centre advises in a variety of areas of law, including human rights, family law, employment law, and more.
        <br><br>
        In areas of employment law, CLC can only assist those earning less than $67,000 annually, or who were doing so prior to dismissal. They cannot advise with regards to certain matters of employment law, such unpaid wages, contracts or work cover. Further, CLC can only assist employees in employment law, not contractors. 
        <br><br>
        To seek advice, call (07) 3214 6333 between 09:00-16:00 Mondays to Fridays. 
        <br><br>
        Due to limited resources, while CLC will endeavour to advise and refer, they can only handle casework in limited circumstances. In some courts, CLC offers a duty lawyer service."
